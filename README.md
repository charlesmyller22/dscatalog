# DSCatalog

# About the project

DSCatalog is like an e-commerce application. We're going to have parts where only Admins can access, validations and so on. The application is an example of skills I use on a daily basis. 
Every once in a while I come back to this project and update something or do some tests just to keep me on track. 
Even though it's a backend project, I will soon integrate it with Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap and all that frontend stuff, turning it into then a fullstack application. 
The API will also pass through some tests with RestAssured and Jacoco.
